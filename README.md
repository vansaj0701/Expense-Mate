# Expense Mate

The Expense Mate is a web-based application that allows users to manage their income and expenses efficiently. Built with Flask and SQLite, it provides a user-friendly platform for tracking financial data. Users can register, log in, and input their expenses under different categories. The app calculates total income, total expenses, and current balance, helping users maintain better control over their finances.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight relational database used to store user and expense data.
- **Werkzeug**: A WSGI utility library for password hashing.


## Installation

Follow the steps below to get the application running on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vansaj0701/Expense-Mate.git
    cd expense-tracker
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Set up the database:

    The database (`expense.db`) will be automatically created when you first run the app.

6. Run the application:

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

7. Open the app in your browser at:

    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```

5. **Edit Income**: To update your income, go to `/edit_amount` and provide your new income along with your password for authentication.


## Database Schema

The app uses an SQLite database with the following tables:

- **users**: Stores user information.
  - `user_id`: Primary key, auto-incremented.
  - `name`: User's full name.
  - `email`: User's email (unique).
  - `amount`: Total income.
  - `password`: Hashed password.

- **expenses**: Stores expenses for each user.
  - `expense_id`: Primary key, auto-incremented.
  - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing `users.user_id`.
  - `category`: Category of the expense (e.g., "travel", "food", etc.).
  - `amount`: Amount spent.
  - `date_added`: Date when the expense was added.


## Security

- Passwords are securely stored using hashing via `werkzeug.security`.
- Sessions are managed using Flask's session system with server-side storage (via Flask-Session).


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-Session
- SQLite (default database, no installation needed)
